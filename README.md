# Bishop

An [android executive officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(Aliens)) assigned to assist with your lunchtime needs. Inspired by [`ripley`](https://github.com/TabbedOut/ripley) and the ongoing camaraderie with former ~TapOut~ TabbedOut software engineers who like to eat and drink. Paying with a phone is optional.

## The Idea(s)

### Locations
- build a database of locations for lunch
- provide an easy way to add or update locations to the database with an emphasis on a straightforward user experience
- integrations with Yelp or other services to pull in menu information?
  -  maybe something that integrates with points of sale like [Toast](https://pos.toasttab.com/partners)?

### Scheduling
- integration with Google Calendar to update events with locations and attendees
- provide an easy way for users to add themselves to a given event

### Coordination
- Slack polls for picking upcoming venues
  - Randomly? select a few venues for an upcoming week for people to vote on
- Slack as the primarly interface for:
  - adding and updating venues

### Pies In the Sky
- automatic "time to leave" reminders for folks attending a lunch
-
